## `data`
This folder houses the raw and clean data from both, the historical (2013) and current (2022) elevational data on amphibians. 

- *Study site* : The study was carried out in the reserve of the Manu Learning Centre research station (71°23ʹ28.06”W; 12°47ʹ21.849”S, 460 m asl), located in the Manu Biosphere Reserve (southeast Peru). The altitudinal gradient is situated in the Piñi-Piñi mountain range. It covers a straight-line distance of 4 km that spans from the lowest areas next to the bank of the Alto Madre de Dios River (~450 m asl) to the peaks of the range (~1200 m asl).

## Historical data
- This data is coming from Villacampa et al. (2019) https://doi.org/10.1080/23766808.2019.1659022

- Data collection was carried out during a three-month period in the 2013 dry season, from mid-June to mid-September. Four altitudinal bands were defined: 450–550, 650–750, 850–950 and 1050–1150 m asl, and ten 100 m long linear transects were marked in each band, giving a total of 40 transect sampling locations


## Current data
- This data is part of the first chapter for my PhD and was collected from mid-June to mid-September 2022. We replicated the study following the same methodology and using the same transect locations from the historical study
